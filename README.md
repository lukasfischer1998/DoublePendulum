# Double Pendulum Simulation

This is a simple simulation of a double pendulum implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

A double pendulum is a classic example of a chaotic dynamical system. It consists of two or as many as you'de like pendulums attached to each other. The behavior of a double pendulum is highly sensitive to initial conditions and can exhibit chaotic behavior.
